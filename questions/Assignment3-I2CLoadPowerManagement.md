*Be sure to take measurements with logging disabled to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See the file: Instructions to add screenshots in assignment.docx in the ECEN 5823 Student Public Folder.* 

1. What is the average current per period? (Remember, once you have measured your average current, average current is average current over all time. Average current doesnâ€™t carry with it the units of the timespan over which it was measured).
   Answer: Average current per period is around 306 uA.

2. What is the ave current from the time we sleep the MCU to EM3 until we power-on the 7021 in response to the LETIMER0 UF IRQ? 
   Answer: Average current during EM3 sleep is around 2.7 uA.

3. What is the ave current from the time we power-on the 7021 until the polled implementation of timerWaitUs() returns, indicating that the 7021's maximum time for conversion (measurement) has expired.
   Answer: Average current during 7021 power-on is around 4.96mA.
